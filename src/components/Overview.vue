        Although I have years of experience as a VueJS developer, all of the code I've worked on
        is proprietary andf can not be shared. So, I created this simple Vue app as a sandbox to
        explore concepts and demonstrate a basic understabnding of the framework.  
    </p>
    <p>
        This web app merely tracks the cities and specific breweries in which I have performed 
        as a musician for my <a href="http://www.coloradosessions.com/" target="_blank">Colorado Sessions</a> project. It is written
        in Typescript utilizing Interfaces and classes.  It currently employs the following concepts:
        <ul>
            <li>Composition API & Composables</li>
            <li>Typescript</li>
            <li>Interfaces for data typing</li>
            <li>Vue Router</li>
            <li>Scoped Styles</li>
            <li>Parent child Component Architecture</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      As I develop it, I will incorporate the additional VueJS concepts:
      <ul>

            <li>Connectivity to an external MySQL database via Axios</li>
            <li>Vue Router</li>
            <li>VueX Store</li>
            <li>Vuetify</li>
            <li>Scoped slots</li>
            <li>Component Architecture</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
